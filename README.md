## Bugs and Feature Requests

If you have a feature request, a question or you would like to file a bug report, please use this
[GitHub issue tracker](/issues).

We recommend that you search the issue tracker to check if someone else has already reported the issue and whether
there is a known solution that you can use. This would be the fastest way for you to find a solution to any issue
that you are currently facing.

If you are adding a bug report, please add detailed steps to reproduce the bug, the NativeRest version you're using,
and your OS version. Any additional files (collections, data dumps, console errors, screenshots) would be very helpful
and would help us to narrow down the issue as quickly as possible.

Also, any questions, feedback and issues you can email us directly at
[support@nativesoft.com](mailto:support@nativesoft.com) or can be sent to
